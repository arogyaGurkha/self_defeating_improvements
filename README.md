# Self-Defeating Improvements
This repository contains code reproducing all the experiments in the paper _"Fixes That Fail: Self-Defeating Improvements in Machine-Learning Systems"_ by Ruihan Wu, Chuan Guo, Awni Hannun, and Laurens van der Maaten.

The code for the SVHN experiments is in separate folders. The SVHN experiments are in the `svhn_based_exp` folder, and the pseudo-LiDAR experiments are in the `pseudo_lidar_exp` folder. Please see the `README.md` file in those folders for details on how to run the experiments.
